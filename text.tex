github user is kathrynthegreat
grab this repo: 2 R files and 2 csvs
Hers's the url

i'll go up here and type these commands into the command prompt and you'll follow along
But type in. If you don't know how it works, type it in!

Basics: Vectors and Object Creation
often your code is different directory than your data. 
people have lots of opinions of folder structure
mixing data and source files


Every programming language-you assign variables' names so we can reference them later
so here we're assigning 5 vector element to x


before you google the command use help! better to stay in the IDE and learn the documentation
google should be a supplement

editing--
programming languages start with 0 (python, C)
R starts with 1. the first element is 1. 


Data type
R has a wide variety of data types including scalars, vectors (numerical, character, logical), matrices, data frames, and lists.
strings are composed of characters

You have  a list of things and those things can be any type of class
up key pulls the last command (amazing life saver)


In R, the information in 'x' is recycled to 
create a vector that is the same length as 'y'.

Named Argument (ordering doesn't matter!)-it explicitly has the name in the function call
 o <- order(x, decreasing=TRUE)
 
 #Z has a dim, whearas a vector or list
 Lists can be long, arrays and matrices you find pretty quickly what your dimensions are.
